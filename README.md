# Set
[Set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(card_game)) is a simple card game, where you need to collect certain combinations of cards from those laid out on the table. See also [Numberphile on this game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkFX9jUJPKk) for detailed explanation of rules.

This web-based implementation of a singleplayer with leaderboard is going to be built in JavaScript and Python with Flask.
