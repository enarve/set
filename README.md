# Set
[Set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(card_game)) is a simple card game, where you need to collect certain combinations of cards from those laid out on the table. See also [Numberphile on this game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkFX9jUJPKk) for detailed explanation of rules.

This web-based implementation of a singleplayer with leaderboard is built in Python with Flask on the backend and HTML, CSS and Javascript on the front.

To run the app, navigate to the project folder, install the packages from `requirements.txt` and use `flask run`:
```sh
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
```sh
$ flask run
